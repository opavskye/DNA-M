List of stuff to be done:

1) improve file reading and input
2) make createBuckets() use coalesced memory access
3) COMPLETE make sequencer choose a random sequence for createBuckets()

IMPORTANT:  sequencer kernel may not be able to handle large data sets
            counter kernel should not be able to handle large data sets


Strategy ideas:

1) only keep counts of each bucket, then when we need to find where
    that sequence is, just create a separate program which searches
    for the string we're interested in and then says where all of
    the instances of it are2) add buckets when a segment doesn't match any of the old ones?

3) do a bunch of tests so that it doesn't matter which sequence
    is randomly chosen
